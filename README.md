Abstract:
In this project the existing Nordic 32 test system was analysed in DIgSilent PowerFactory and
approached to the actual Swedish transmission grid. Focus was the real location of the load and
generation. On one hand, the installed capacity was nearly quadrupled, on the other hand the geographic
location of the plants was considered. Therefore, the four most important generation types, hydro-,
nuclear-, wind and thermal power areincluded into the model. Furthermore, the four electricity areas
SE1 - SE4 were adoptedinto the test system and the transnational connection modelled as well. The
modified test system allows simulations based on real operation statistics. In this project, the complete
year 2018 was simulated in an hourly resolution. The stable grid operation within the given voltage limits
were secured by static and dynamic reactive suppliers. A validation of the active power flows shows the
coincidence of the simulation results and the real operation data of 2018. Hence, the resultant grid model
represents the Swedish transmission grid more accurate and offers plenty of different study
cases. Furthermore, it gives the yearly voltage profile for each bus and helps to identify weak and strong
regions in the Swedish transmission grid.
